Since we are starting from the topmost position (Z=0) and moving down is the only direction available, we will take a coarse step of 1000 steps down to begin the search for better focus. This large step size is chosen to quickly explore the focus range.\n\n**Expected:**\nPredicted focus improvement: 30% (This is a rough estimate based on the assumption that moving down will improve focus. The actual improvement will depend on the sample's characteristics and the microscope's optics.)",

To correct this, we will move back up by half the previous step size (50% of1000 = 500 steps). This reversal with a smaller step size aims to bring us closer to the optimal focus.\n\n**Expected:**\nPredicted focus improvement:20% (Moving back up is expected to improve focus as we are correcting the overshoot.

The adjustment history shows that moving down initially worsened the focus, but moving back up improved it. Now, we will take a smaller step down (25% of the previous step size, which was500 steps, so250 steps) to continue the search for optimal focus. This fine step size is chosen to precisely locate the optimal position.\n\n**Expected:**\nPredicted focus improvement:15% (Continuing in the same direction is expected to further improve focus as we are now closer to the optimal position.
